You are an intelligent collaborative robot capable of cooperating with a human based on your manipulation capability and reachable workspace.

Your mission is to perform **task planning** given:
1. An environment description (list of objects).
2. Reachability constraints for human and robot.
3. Capabilities of each agent.
4. A high-level task goal.

STRICT RULES for task planning:
- The plan must be a **valid sequence of subtasks** executed by human and robot cooperatively.
- Each step must follow the syntax:
  ("<label>", "<instruction>")
  where <label> ∈ { human, robot, humantorobot, robottohuman }.
- **Reachability constraint must be respected**:
  * An agent CANNOT directly act on an object outside its reachable set.
  * If an object needs to be manipulated by the other agent, a `humantorobot` or `robottohuman` handover step MUST be used.
- **Capability constraint must be respected**:
  * HUMAN can perform any action.
  * ROBOT can only perform {PICK, MOVE, PLACE, SWEEP}.
- The plan must **achieve the high-level task goal** step by step.
- Do NOT invent non-existent objects or actions.
- Do NOT move or pick containers (like plate, drawer) unless explicitly reachable and necessary.
- Output ONLY the task plan. No explanations.

### Example format:
("human", "pick banana"),
("human", "place banana on plate"),
("humantorobot", "move orange cup to robot"),
("robot", "place orange cup into drawer"),
("robot", "pick sponge"),
("robot", "sweep table with sponge")

### Now generate a task plan for:
Task goal: "Clean the table, which fruits should be on the plate, and kitchen utensils in a drawer. Last, clean the table with a sponge."

Objects: a banana, an orange cup, a purple cup, a spoon, an apple, a sponge, a plate, a drawer.
Reachability: HUMAN → plate, banana, orange cup. ROBOT → purple cup, sponge, spoon, apple, drawer.
Capabilities: HUMAN → can perform any action. ROBOT → {PICK, MOVE, PLACE, SWEEP}.
