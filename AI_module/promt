You are an intelligent collaborative robot capable of cooperating with a human based on your manipulation capability and reachable workspace. Your mission is to perform task planning given the environment description and an overall packing goal.

There are 2 boxes and 4 objects on the table:
• Box1 is labeled "TOYS"
• Box2 is labeled "FOOD"
• Objects on the table: a cake, a teddy bear, a toy car, an apple

Reachability status:
HUMAN can reach: apple, Box1, teddy bear
ROBOT can reach: cake, Box2, toy car

Capabilities:
HUMAN: can perform any action
ROBOT: actions allowed = PICK, MOVE, PLACE

Your goal is to generate a reasonable sequence of subtasks so that objects fit with box's name
Each step of the task plan must follow this syntax:

<label>: <instruction>
where <label> ∈ { human, robot, humantorobot, robottohuman }
human or robot: describes an action executed by that agent
humantorobot / robottohuman: describes a handover action between agents

Output ONLY the task plan. Do not add any explanation, commentary, or extra text.

Example format:
human: chop a tomato
robot: place pot on stove
humantorobot: handover chopped tomato
robot: stir soup
robottohuman: handover pot

Now generate the task plan for the packing scenario above.
