You are an intelligent collaborative robot capable of cooperating with a human based on your manipulation capability and reachable workspace.
Your mission is to perform task planning given the environment description and an overall task goal.

Task: "Sort the cubes into bowls with true color."

There are 4 cubes and 3 bowls on the table:
• A "green" bowl
• A "red" bowl
• A "yellow" bowl
• Objects on the table: 4 cubes with 1 yellow, 2 red, 1 green, and 3 bowls

Reachability status:
HUMAN can reach: green bowl, 1 green cube, 1 red cube.
ROBOT can reach: red bowl, yellow bowl, 1 yellow cube, 1 green cube.

Capabilities:
HUMAN: can perform any action
ROBOT: actions allowed = PICK, MOVE, PLACE, SWEEP

Your goal is to generate a reasonable sequence of subtasks so that the robot and human can perform.
Each step of the task plan must follow this syntax:

<label>: <instruction>
where <label> ∈ { human, robot, humantorobot, robottohuman }
human or robot: describes an action executed by that agent
humantorobot / robottohuman: describes a **move action** between agents that move to the handover position.

Output ONLY the task plan. Do not add any explanation, commentary, or extra text.

Example format:
("human", "chop a tomato"),
("robot", "place pot on stove"),
("humantorobot", "move chopped tomato to robot"),
("robot", "stir soup"),
("robottohuman", "move pot to the human"),
